**Expanding Breadfruit Tree Availability through Tissue Culture for Kauai Farmers**

### **Project Overview and Sector-Specific Focus**

**Project Title**: Expanding Breadfruit Tree Availability through Tissue Culture for Kauai Farmers

**Project Summary**

This project addresses the demand for breadfruit saplings in hopes to increase sustainable agriculture on Kauai. The primary research question investigates ways to optimize tissue culture technology to enhance the production and accessibility of breadfruit trees for local farmers. Current tissue culture methods have inefficiencies, creating a bottleneck in sapling availability, particularly in the rooting and hardening off stages as plantlets are transitioned to the greenhouse environment. Several key innovations in this project include a modified rooting system in the breadfruit tissue culture protocol and the introduction of a tissue culture hardening-off process called **hydro-culture**, which will streamline the transition of breadfruit saplings from in-vitro conditions to greenhouse environments. By demonstrating the benefits of hydro-culture for breadfruit growers, the project offers a novel, scalable solution that addresses current bottlenecks in tissue culture propagation.

To solve this problem, the project will collaborate with University of Hawaii researchers to modify and streamline existing tissue culture protocols and create a tissue culture lab on Kauai as a hub to receive and harden off tissue culture plantlets to distribute to Kauai farmers. 

The potential significance of this project lies in its ability to advance sustainable agriculture by increasing the supply of breadfruit saplings. Expected outcomes include increased breadfruit availability, strengthened local food systems, and enhanced agricultural resilience on Kauai. Additionally, the project supports agroforestry systems that promote soil fertility and reduces dependency on chemical inputs, aligning with sustainable farming practices.

Dissemination of the project’s results will occur through partnerships with the Ulu Cooperative, engagement with local farmers, and collaboration with research institutions. Through the distribution of breadfruit trees and information on growing breadfruit the project will support a model for other agricultural stakeholders in Hawaii. This initiative will help meet immediate sapling demands and foster long-term sustainability and resilience in the region’s agricultural landscape.

**Project Narrative**:

**Relevance to Sustainable Agriculture, Project Value and Benefits:**

This project directly contributes to the goals of sustainable agriculture by enhancing the availability of a climate-resilient, nutritionally rich crop that has deep cultural significance in Hawaii. Breadfruit trees offer numerous benefits to sustainable farming, including low input requirements, high productivity, and the ability to thrive in diverse climates. Breadfruit trees require minimal chemical inputs, help improve soil fertility, and can support agroforestry systems, which in turn promote biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The Hawai’i Ulu Co-op has been successful in promoting and building a viable, and economical market for breadfruit farmers in recent years. The Hawai’i Ulu co-op in collaboration with UH researchers have also been successful in providing breadfruit saplings to farmers through means of traditional propagation, as well as propagation utilizing tissue culture methods. However, as breadfruit increases in popularity, current tissue culture workflows cannot keep up with the high demand for breadfruit saplings. Kauai farmers face a significant challenge in accessing a sufficient supply of breadfruit saplings, limiting their ability to cultivate this valuable crop. This project addresses the challenge by introducing a critical step in the tissue culture protocol that will alleviate current bottlenecks, increasing the capacity for large-scale production of genetically consistent, disease-free breadfruit trees specifically for farmers on the island of Kauai. 

**Sector-Specific Alignment**:  
The project's emphasis on using tissue culture technology also aligns with the innovative, research-driven approaches championed by WSARE, ensuring the long-term sustainability and scalability of breadfruit farming on Kauai.

### **Alignment with WSARE's Funding Priorities**

**Innovation and Research**:  
This project introduces significant innovation by addressing critical bottlenecks in the existing tissue culture protocol for breadfruit propagation. While tissue culture is an effective method for rapidly increasing the number of breadfruit saplings, the current workflow involves high operating costs and inefficiencies, particularly during the rooting and hardening stages, where plantlets are transitioned from in-vitro to greenhouse environments. The proposed modification to the protocol will streamline the process by reducing the amount of subculturing required and creating a method for shipping plantlets in-vitro. Additionally, this new approach will empower farmers by providing them with an easy-to-follow protocol for hardening off the plants at their final destination. By distributing the workload and minimizing bottlenecks at a single tissue culture lab, this innovation will allow for large-scale production and distribution of breadfruit trees to meet farmer demand.

**Farmer/Rancher Involvement**:  
As the primary farm leading the project, we will establish and demonstrate a scalable model for increasing the supply of breadfruit saplings, directly contributing to the on-farm research that WSARE prioritizes. Other farmers and stakeholders in Hawaii will benefit from the increased availability of breadfruit saplings for planting, which is crucial to meeting the growing demand for this valuable crop. By alleviating the bottlenecks in the tissue culture process and enabling local farmers to harden off saplings at their own farms, the project also enhances farmer engagement and self-sufficiency. The collaboration with the Ulu Cooperative will further ensure that the trees are efficiently distributed to farmers, supporting sustainable agricultural practices across the region.

**Regional Impact**:  
This project directly addresses the agricultural challenges specific to Hawaii and the broader western U.S. region, particularly the need for sustainable, high-value crops that can support local food production. By increasing the availability of breadfruit, a culturally and nutritionally significant crop, the project will strengthen local food systems and promote agricultural resilience. Breadfruit trees require minimal inputs and can thrive in Hawaii’s diverse climates, making them an ideal choice for sustainable farming. The success of this project will not only benefit individual farmers but also contribute to the broader goals of sustainability, food security, and economic resilience in the region.

### **Storytelling for Engagement**

**Personal Connection to the Project**:  
Breadfruit is more than just a crop for me—it’s a passion that has shaped my academic and professional journey. My connection with breadfruit began during my time as a college student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where I volunteered at the student organic farm program. While harvesting breadfruit trees for produce sales, I explored the many ways this remarkable food could be prepared and quickly became fond of its potential as a sustainable food source. Throughout my studies, I gained invaluable experience caring for breadfruit trees across campus, and I developed a deep respect for this crop’s ability to nourish both people and the land.

One of the most impactful experiences during my studies was working on tissue culture protocol development. Although I didn’t have the opportunity to work with breadfruit directly as a student, I developed critical technical skills that I later applied to breadfruit propagation. After graduating, I was fortunate to secure a part-time job that provided me with the space and resources to start a breadfruit tissue culture lab. During this time, I successfully established two breadfruit varieties into tissue culture and ramped up production. The current breadfruit tissue culture lab at the Komohana Research Center in Hilo is a direct result of my work. My relationship with the Principal Investigator remains strong, and I am now eager to reconnect with my past, working alongside the Komohana lab to take breadfruit propagation to the next level, benefiting farmers across Hawaii.

**Case Study or Real-World Example**:  
Currently, the Komohana tissue culture lab partners with the Hawaii Ulu Cooperative to provide breadfruit saplings to farmers who want to expand their agroforestry projects. However, despite the lab’s high productivity, the demand for breadfruit saplings far exceeds its current capacity. Farmers across Hawaii are eager to plant breadfruit, but without an adequate supply of saplings, they are unable to meet this demand. By addressing the bottlenecks in the tissue culture process, this project aims to significantly increase the supply of saplings, empowering more farmers to grow breadfruit and contributing to the growth of sustainable agriculture in Hawaii.

**Vision for Success**:  
Success for this project will begin with the establishment of a new breadfruit tissue culture lab on Kauai, which will produce and distribute 600 saplings in the first year. This initial success will demonstrate a scalable model that can be replicated across other Hawaiian islands, ensuring that farmers throughout the region have access to the saplings they need. By alleviating the current bottlenecks in the tissue culture process, we will not only increase the availability of breadfruit saplings but also contribute to the sustainability and resilience of Hawaii’s agricultural systems. In the long term, the expansion of breadfruit agroforestry will help strengthen local food production and provide a model for other regions looking to embrace sustainable agricultural practices.

### **Adaptation Strategies**

**Tailoring for WSARE**:  
This project is a strong fit for WSARE’s priorities of innovation, sustainability, and regional impact. One of the key innovations in this project is the introduction of a tissue culture hardening-off process called **hydro-culture**, which will streamline the transition of breadfruit saplings from in-vitro conditions to greenhouse environments. By demonstrating the benefits of hydro-culture for breadfruit growers, the project offers a novel, scalable solution that addresses current bottlenecks in tissue culture propagation.

Additionally, breadfruit farming as an agroforestry system is deeply aligned with sustainable agricultural practices. Breadfruit trees require minimal inputs, enhance soil fertility, and provide long-term ecological benefits. By supporting local breadfruit cultivation, this project will significantly increase Hawaii’s capacity for local food production, which contributes to the region’s agricultural resilience and food security. This project is not only innovative but also practical, offering immediate benefits to local farmers while supporting WSARE’s mission of promoting sustainable agriculture in the western U.S.

**Scalability**:  
This project has significant potential for scalability. With additional funding, the scope of the project can easily be expanded by increasing the footprint of both the tissue culture lab and the greenhouse. More funding would also expedite the project timeline, enabling faster production and distribution of breadfruit saplings to farmers across Hawaii.

As proposed, the project represents a minimum scale that meets the core objectives of producing and distributing 600 saplings within two years. However, if only partial funding is received, the timeline for achieving these objectives will likely be delayed. While the project could still proceed with reduced funding, it would require adjustments to the timeline or the scope of sapling production to align with the available resources.
