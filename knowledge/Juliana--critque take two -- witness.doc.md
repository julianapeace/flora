Film Critique – Witness						Mr. Vallone

Witness  
	Witness is another Peter Weir tour de force; directed in 1985, its Reaganomics-era setting lays the foundation for a murder mystery involving two-faced cops as well as a comparison movie of two different worlds: the Amish world and the modern world.  In the sense that both these worlds are—to a degree—exclusive, as well as xenophobic, the film is fraught with fish out of water irony, as well as a theme that it doesn’t take much more than humanity to assimilate. Although Witness *is* a good crime film, it is too trite to be unique within its genre. It is the addition of these contrasting worlds—neither of which Harrison Ford (char. name?) seems to fit in--that makes this otherwise ordinary crime movie a bit different less so.
